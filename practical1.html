        <p><b>Calculus</b>, a branch of Mathematics, developed by <b><i>Newton and Leibniz</i></b>, deals with the study of the rate of change. elculas define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup> CM is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optimal solutions. <i>It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function</i>. Calculus Math mainly focused on some important topics such as <b>differentiation</b>, <b>integration</b>, <b>limits</b>,
            <b>functions</b>, and so on.H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>
